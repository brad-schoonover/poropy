        # Problem
        # =======
        
        # This is a small 69 assembly core modeled as a quarter
        # core.  It has three roughly equal batches composed of fresh,
        # once-, and twice-burned fuel.  The materials actually
        # correspond a 17x17, 4.25 w/o, 92 IFBA PWR assembly at 
        # 0, 15, and 30 MWd/kg.  The assembly pitch is 20.5036, 
        # so this benchmark is not using the data realistically.
        # The default pattern is a
        
        # Stencil
        # =======
        
        # First, define the stencil.  Fuel regions are positive
        # integers, where each value corresponds to a "region". 
        # In an optimization sequence, the user can exclude regions
        # from the search space completely.  Currently, this isn't
        # used, but there is an option to fixed the central bundle 
        # directly.
        # Note the whole stencil must be specified, even if certain locations
        # are to be fixed by rotational symmetry.  This makes it easier
        # for the user visually (and makes implementation a bit easier).

        # is standard.  The stencil is indexed as would be any matrix.
        # Hence a fuel location [i,j] corresponds to the [i,j]th location
        # in the pattern (using 0-based indexing)  In other words, there is 
        # no alpha-numeric scheme.
        
        # Initial Loading Pattern
        # =======================
        
        # The pattern is a 1-D array of fuel identifiers.  These 
        # identifiers correspond to assemblies to be defined below.
        # Unlike above, fuel is not specified if it is constrained by
        # rotation symmetry.  The fuel indices as 
        # listed correspond to the their location in stencil using
        # a row-major storage.  We work with 1-D data for simplicity.
